          <ol>
            <li>
              <h3><strong>DIMENSIONS. </strong>FIFA Law 1 provides for flexible external field dimensions
within a given maximum and minimum width and length. These
dimensions should be adhered to for all fields used by teams under 12
and older.</h3>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3><strong>COMPETITION FIELDS. </strong>Fields used within the competition program must
be a minimum of 100 x 60 yards. Leagues, districts or associations
participating in the state competition program that are unable to provide a
field that meets these minimum requirements must advise the State
Competition Board which will assign its Fields Committee to inspect the
field and recommend to the Board whether or not a waiver of the minimum
dimensions should be granted. Teams from leagues, districts or
associations that are unable to provide an acceptable field may be
required to play all their games away.</h3>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3><strong>FIELDS USED BY YOUNG AGE GROUPS.</h3>
              <ol type="a">
                <li>
                  <h3>U-6 play on a field approximately 20 X 40 yards with no penalty
areas. Fields for older age groups should be progressively larger.</h3>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h3>U-8 plays on a field 40-50 yards in length and 20-30 yards width.</h3>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h3>U-10 play on a field 70-80 yards in length and 40-50 yards in width.</h3>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h3>In addition, fields used by young age groups may have their internal
dimensions and size of goal similarly modified.</h3>

                      <h3>The decision for team/spectator placement on the field will
be made by the governing body of that team. A team’s
bench area shall consist of that area at least one (1) yard
away from the touchline and extending to twenty yards (20)
both ways from the halfway line. In the event that field conditions require team benches to be on the same side of
the field, a team’s bench area shall consist of that area two
(2) yards away from the touchline and extending twenty
yards one (1) way from the halfway line.</h3>

locate its bench area. Coaches and substitutes are required
to remain within their bench area during the game. Parents
and spectators should occupy the same side of the field as
the team they are supporting.</h3>

                      <h3>Except where it is determined by the referee to be
impractical, team bench areas shall be along the same
touchline. Each team bench area shall be located two yards
outside the touchline, beginning not closer than five yards
from midfield and extending not further than twenty yards
from midfield. The home team shall have the right to choose
the location of its bench area. Coaches and substitutes must
remain within their team's bench area during the game.</h3>

                      <h3>Parents and spectators must occupy the sideline opposite
the team bench areas. Supporters of a team must assemble
on the side of the midfield facing the team bench area of that
team. There shall be a buffer zone extending ten yards on
each side of the midfield that may not be occupied by
parents or spectators. Match officials shall be empowered to
enforce these provisions and may suspend or terminate
games in the event that any team, coach, parent, or
spectator declines to abide by requests from match officials
to comply with these standards.</h3>
